Description of Components:
User Interface (Frontend):

The frontend can be a simple web interface where the user enters their job role, industry, and seniority level.

It communicates with the backend API to get assessment recommendations based on the inputs.

Express.js API (Backend Server):

This handles incoming HTTP requests from the frontend.

It receives user data (job role, industry, and seniority) and processes it by sending it to the recommendation engine.

It serves as a middle layer between the frontend and the database.

Recommendation Engine Logic:

The recommendation engine performs the core logic of the application, using techniques like:

Cosine Similarity: To match the job role with the most relevant assessments.

String Matching (Jaro-Winkler distance): To calculate similarity between input roles and assessments.

NLP Techniques: Used for processing and comparing textual data.

MongoDB Atlas (Database):

Stores the assessments data.

It is a NoSQL cloud-based database (MongoDB Atlas) where all assessments and related metadata are stored.

User queries can be stored here for analytics and further optimization of the recommendation engine.

Data Flow:
User Input: The user provides their job role, industry, and seniority through the frontend.

API Request: The frontend sends a request to the Express.js backend with the user's data.

Recommendation Logic: The backend processes the request using the recommendation engine, which fetches data from the database and processes it to generate suitable assessments.

Database Interaction: The backend retrieves the assessments from the database (MongoDB Atlas) and uses the engine logic to filter and sort assessments based on the user's inputs.

Response: The backend sends the recommendations back to the frontend to be displayed to the user.

Tools and Technologies:
Frontend: React.js (for UI rendering)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js (handling API requests)

Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud storage for assessments data)

NLP Libraries: natural for text processing and similarity calculation

Similarity Calculation: compute-cosine-similarity, Jaro-Winkler distance
